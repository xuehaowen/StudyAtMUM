The problems to solve are in package named, pipeline, in startup-code folder.

The classes you will query, like Employee and Address, are all contained
in the quizclasses package. Test data is created in the two "test data"
classes in that package -- to get test data, call either getList (on EmployeeTestData)
or getTransactions (on TraderTransactTestData).

In the pipeline package, there is a file named, Main.java. It contains 4 problems in the form
of methods prob1(), prob2(), prob3(). Each needs to be solved with
a stream pipeline; instructions for each are in the comments for each.

When you run the main method, it will run the Prob0 and then
execute prob1(), prob2(), prob3().
