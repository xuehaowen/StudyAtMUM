This code is intended to demonstrate Test-Driven Development process
in a simple case.

We wish to implement a method addressListToStringArrList
in the class util.Util. We know the method's signature
and return type. Even before coding the method, we
can devise a test for it, which we do in test_util.TestUtil.
Then we can write our code, and test.
